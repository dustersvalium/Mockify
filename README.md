# Mockify
This program serves as a multi-user playlist manager where any group of friends or family can listen to songs on a shared playlist in
which each member can participate. The program will allow users to edit their playlists by adding or removing songs they’ve heard &
thought would make a great addition or remove songs that don’t quite fit.

I have always wished for such a feature to exist on my music player app (Apple Music) and since the feature is only assumed to be
released later this year, I thought it good to make my own version.
I not only wanted the program to perform the adaptive feature but also to make it as interactive and efficient as possible.
